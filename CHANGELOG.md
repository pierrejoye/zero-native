# Changelog

All notable changes to zero-native will be documented in this file.

## 0.1.2

<!-- release:start -->

### Bug Fixes

- **npm install fallback** - Do not fail package installation or point global shims at missing binaries when a native release asset is unavailable.
- **Release asset ordering** - Upload the macOS arm64 native binary and `CHECKSUMS.txt` before publishing the npm package so postinstall downloads succeed immediately.
